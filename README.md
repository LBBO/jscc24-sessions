# jscc24-sessions

We like to collect session notes for all sessions if possible. If you have slides for your session or took notes - please share them with all of us!

This repository will be filled later, as soon as the JSCC starts.

Create a directory for the session, add a README.md into it and add a link to it in the table below.

Thank you for your support!

## Sessions
