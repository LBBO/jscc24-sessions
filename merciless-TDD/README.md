In our session we TDDed every little step, unfortunately there is only one commit
and this is only the final result after we TDDed the code.
We discussed naming, product requirements, etc. in depth and refactored a lot, etc.
The code is here https://codeberg.org/wolframkriesing/jslang-meetups/src/branch/main/jscc24-tdd/test.js

This video is about more than TDD but in the middle [@jbrains](https://github.com/jbrains) explains TDD "quickly" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSes_PexXcA
